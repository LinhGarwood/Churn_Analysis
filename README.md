# Churn Analysis

This project centers on analyzing and visualizing churn data using Power BI. I've applied exploratory data analysis techniques and will leverage DAX to create visualizations. By examining demographic details, churn reasons, group contracts, and customer tenure, the goal is to identify factors impacting churn. Ultimately, this analysis will help the organization to have strategies to improve customer retention.
